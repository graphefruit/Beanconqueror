# Beanconqueror

A cup of coffee is not the same anymore then back in the 80's, thats why I wanted to build a tool for the coffee community.

Coffee has been grown to like the new "black gold", more roasters and more tools outside are growing.

Apart from the mechanical tools like grinders, portafilters etc, the app stores are pretty full of coffee apps.

But none is taken care about the community needs are open source and neither grew up from the own coffee fascination like on my side.

Thats why I build and maintain the Beanconqueror app for you, for me, for every coffee lover outside there.

Download today, track your brews, change your recipes, to get the best tasting cup of coffee you've ever had.

## Features

Different features are supported by this app, a brief overview you'll find here.

- Add your own beans / grinders / preparation methods
- Record different brew-parameters like:
  - grind size
  - grind amount
  - brew time
  - first coffee drip
  - images 
  - etc.
- Manage your own workflow, first grind amount, then grind size? No problem
- Archive old beans / grinders / preparation methods
- Rate your brews
- Cup your brews by SCA

## Questions

### Why is external storage not supported?
Sadly there are some issues to read/use files from external storage
https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/issues/350

### Why is image-export functionality not support on iOS?
iOS filesystem is different then on Android, because of this images cannot just be exported.
Thats why just Android is support by now.

### Which requirements does the app needs?
The app needs access to your filesystem aswell as the camera

*Filesytem*: Needed to save images which you took on beans/brews etc.
*Camera*: Needed to take picures or access the photo library to set images for your beans/brews
*Internet*: NOT NEEDED! But needed if you want to send me some analytics information to make the app better :)

## Issues with iOS

### Actual Pod issue
```
1. Add this to the pod file
post_install do |pi|
   pi.pods_project.targets.each do |t|
       t.build_configurations.each do |bc|
           bc.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '9.0'
       end
   end
end
2. Goto platform/ios and run pod install
https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/9884
```
If you got other problems try these:
```
1. pod install / pod install --repo-update
or pod repo update
-> this needs to be done in the ios platform

if this doesn't help:

2.
sudo chmod go-w /YourPath/Beanconqueror
pod repo update

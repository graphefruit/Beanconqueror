## Third Party Apps

Beanconqueror Universe is growing outside :)
Therefore some users did third party apps, where I don't have any stakes in it.
Important: Beanconqueror doesn't take any warranty here.

Add beans to share directly from a webform:
https://beanstats.vercel.app/beanconqueror/share/create
(Uses the minify-logic of the add.beanl.ink aswell)

Minify your shared bean-link:

## Questions

### Why is external storage not supported?

Sadly there are some issues to read/use files from external storage
https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/issues/350

### Why is image-export functionality not support on iOS?

iOS filesystem is different then on Android, because of this images cannot just be exported.
Thats why just Android is support by now.

### iOS - iCloud-Backup

You can backup Beanconqueror via iCloud, with this you can transfer all data to another device without any loss.

### Android - Backup & Restore

Have a look here: [FAQ](https://beanconqueror.com/faq)

### Analytics

All tracked data/analytics are visible here: ![Website](https://beanconqueror.com/data-tracking.html)

### Which requirements does the app needs?

The app needs access to your filesystem aswell as the camera

- _Filesytem_: Needed to save images which you took on beans/brews etc or exporting your settings. - Outdated after Android 13 changes.
- _Camera_: Needed to take picures or access the photo library to set images for your beans/brews
- _Internet_: NOT NEEDED! But needed if you want to send me some analytics information to make the app better :)
- _GPS_: NOT NEEDED! Activated through settings, saves the brew location
- _Apple Health_: NOT NEEDED! Activated through settings, saves caffeine amount
- _Wake look_: NOT NEEDED! Activated through settings, won't let your phone get into sleep mode while brewing
- _Bluetooth_: NOT NEEDED! Activated for smart scale use.

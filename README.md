# Beanconqueror

A cup of coffee is not the same anymore then back in the 80's, thats why I wanted to build a tool for the coffee community.

Coffee has been grown to like the new "black gold", more roasters and more tools outside are growing.

Apart from the mechanical tools like grinders, portafilters etc, the app stores are pretty full of coffee apps.

But none is taken care about the community needs are open source and neither grew up from the own coffee fascination like on my side.

Thats why I build and maintain the Beanconqueror app for you, for me, for every coffee lover outside there.

Download today, track your brews, change your recipes, to get the best tasting cup of coffee you've ever had.

## Questions

### Why is external storage not supported?
Sadly there are some issues to read/use files from external storage
https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/issues/350

### Why is image-export functionality not support on iOS?
iOS filesystem is different then on Android, because of this images cannot just be exported.
Thats why just Android is support by now.

### iOS - iCloud-Backup
You can backup Beanconqueror via iCloud, with this you can transfer all data to another device without any loss.

### Analytics
All tracked data/analytics are visible here: ![Website](https://beanconqueror.com/data-tracking.html)

### Which requirements does the app needs?
The app needs access to your filesystem aswell as the camera

- *Filesytem*: Needed to save images which you took on beans/brews etc or exporting your settings.
- *Camera*: Needed to take picures or access the photo library to set images for your beans/brews
- *Internet*: NOT NEEDED! But needed if you want to send me some analytics information to make the app better :)
- *GPS*: NOT NEEDED! Activated through settings, saves the brew location
- *Apple Health*: NOT NEEDED! Activated through settings, saves caffeine amount
- *Wake look*: NOT NEEDED! Activated through settings, won't let your phone get into sleep mode while brewing
- *Bluetooth*: NOT NEEDED! Activated for smart scale use.

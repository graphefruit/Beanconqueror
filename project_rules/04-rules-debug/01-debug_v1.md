# AI Assistant - Workflow: Debugging & Error Fixing (FOCUS = DEBUGGING) (Advanced Simplified)

# Applies when internal mode is Act Mode (Cline) / Debug Mode (Roo Code) for a debugging task, OR when task FOCUS is DEBUGGING. Assumes General Principles (File 6) processed.

**Overall Goal:** Diagnose, fix, and verify errors using project context; document findings.

## Process:

1.  **Understand & Contextualize:** Gather error details, steps to reproduce. Check relevant Memory Files (`tasks_plan`, `active_context`, `error-doc`). Reproduce if possible.
2.  **Analyze & Hypothesize:** Analyze failure within project context (`arch`, `tech`). Formulate potential root causes based on evidence and context.
3.  **Identify Cause & Plan Fix:** Pinpoint root cause. Plan minimal fix, ensuring it aligns with project context (`arch`, `tech`). Note any related documentation issues found.
4.  **Implement & Verify:** Apply fix per standards. Run relevant tests (failed, related, new).
5.  **Report & Update:** Report outcome. Provide fix/tests if successful. Propose updates: **`error-documentation.md` (Mandatory)**, `tasks_plan`, `active_context`, potentially `lessons` or flags for core docs. Handle getting stuck by reporting findings and requesting help.

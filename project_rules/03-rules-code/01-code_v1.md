# AI Assistant - Workflow: Implementation & Coding (FOCUS = IMPLEMENTATION) (Advanced Simplified)

# Applies when internal mode is Act Mode (Cline) / Code Mode (Roo Code) for an implementation task, OR when task FOCUS is IMPLEMENTATION. Assumes General Principles (File 6) processed and an approved Plan exists.

**Overall Goal:** Execute plan accurately, ensuring code aligns with context/standards.

## Process:

1.  **Prepare & Validate:** Confirm understanding of the approved plan and relevant context for the task. Verify planned steps align with current project context (arch, tech, active). Halt and report significant conflicts.
2.  **Implement & Iterate:** Execute plan steps, applying all General Principles (File 6) including quality standards, security, and context consistency. Perform checks; self-correct or trigger **Debug Mode** if issues arise.
3.  **Test & Document:** Implement tests per plan. Run tests; trigger **Debug Mode** on failure. Add required documentation.
4.  **Report & Update:** Report task completion status (after any Debug). Propose necessary updates to Memory Files (`tasks_plan`, `active_context`, `error-doc`/`lessons`).

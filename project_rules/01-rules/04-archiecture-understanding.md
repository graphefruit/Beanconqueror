# Architecture Understanding

READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
File: /memory/docs/architecture.md @architecture.md
Required parsing:

1. Load and parse complete Mermaid diagram
2. Extract and understand:
   - Module boundaries and relationships
   - Data flow patterns
   - System interfaces
   - Component dependencies
3. Validate any changes against architectural constraints
4. Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns

Error handling:

1. If file not found: STOP and notify user
2. If diagram parse fails: REQUEST clarification
3. If architectural violation detected: WARN user

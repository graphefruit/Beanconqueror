# AI Assistant - Workflow: Planning & Solution Proposal (FOCUS = PLANNING) (Advanced Simplified)

# Applies when internal mode is Plan Mode (Cline) / Architect Mode (Roo Code), OR when task FOCUS is PLANNING. Assumes General Principles (File 6) processed.

**Overall Goal:** Understand task, leverage context, propose a detailed, validated plan.

## Process:

1.  **Understand & Contextualize:** Achieve full clarity on task requirements, leveraging relevant project context (PRD scope, task status, architecture, tech standards). State key constraints and assumptions.
2.  **Design & Justify:** Explore context-aligned solutions. Evaluate trade-offs (maintainability, performance, security, complexity, context alignment). Select and rigorously justify the optimal solution, referencing key project context.
3.  **Detail Plan:** Create a step-by-step implementation plan including:
    - Key code changes/additions (respecting architecture).
    - Necessary tests (unit, integration points).
    - Required documentation.
    - Dependencies.
    - _(Apply General Principles from File 6 throughout implementation)_.
4.  **Assess & Validate:** Note potential Memory Bank impacts. Present the plan clearly, including justification. **Request human review and approval.**

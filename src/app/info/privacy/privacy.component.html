                <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
                <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                  modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br/>The Data processing is carried out using
                  computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
                  the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain
                  types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales,
                  marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service
                  providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if
                  necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from
                  the Owner at any time.</p>
                <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
                <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations
                    the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
                    (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This,
                    however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data
                    protection law;
                  </li>
                  <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                    pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                  </li>
                  <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
                  <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                    official authority vested in the Owner;
                  </li>
                  <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
                    third party.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                  processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
                  requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
                <h3>Place</h3>
                <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                  involved in the processing are located.<br/><br/> Depending on the User's location, data transfers may
                  involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the
                  place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the
                  processing of Personal Data.</p>
                <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
                  European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by
                  two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard
                  their Data.<br/><br/> If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the
                  relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the
                  contact section.</p>
                <h3>Retention time</h3>
                <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
                  collected for.</p>
                <p>Therefore:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner
                    and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
                  </li>
                  <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as
                    long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
                    legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by
                    contacting the Owner.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                  consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be
                  obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of
                  a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br/><br/> Once the retention period expires,
                  Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
                  rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention
                  period.</p></div>

                <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent
                    where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to object to the
                    processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.
                    Further details are provided in the dedicated section below.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by
                    the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the
                    Data undergoing processing.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of
                    their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right, under certain
                    circumstances, to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process
                    their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right,
                    under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong> Users have the
                    right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                    technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This

                    processing is based on the User's consent, on a contract which the User is part of or on
                    pre-contractual obligations thereof.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent
                    data protection authority.

                </ul>
                <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>
                <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
                  vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may
                  object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the
                  objection.</p>
                <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes,
                  they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether
                  the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant
                  sections of this document. </p>
                <h3>How to exercise these rights</h3>
                <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details
                  provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the
                  Owner as early as possible and always within one month.</p></div>

                <p>This part of the document uses the term “personal information“ as it is defined in The California
                  Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
                <h3>Categories of personal information collected, disclosed or sold</h3>
                <p>In this section we summarize the categories of personal information that we've collected, disclosed
                  or sold and the purposes thereof. <strong>You can read about these activities in detail in the section
                    titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.</strong></p>
                <h4>Information we collect: the categories of personal information we collect</h4>
                <p>We have collected the following categories of personal information about you: identifiers, internet
                  information, geolocation data and inferred information.</p>
                <p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information without notifying you.</p> <h4>How
                  we collect information: what are the sources of the personal information we collect?</h4>
                <p>We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or indirectly,
                  from you when you use this Application.</p>
                <p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via any forms on
                  this Application. You also provide personal information indirectly when you navigate this Application,
                  as personal information about you is automatically observed and collected. Finally, we may collect
                  your personal information from third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or with
                  the functioning of this Application and features thereof.</p> <h4>How we use the information we
                  collect: sharing and disclosing of your personal information with third parties for a business
                  purpose</h4>
                <p>We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a third party for business purposes.
                  In this case, we enter a written agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both
                  keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose(s) other than those
                  necessary for the performance of the agreement.</p>
                <p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when you explicitly ask or authorize
                  us to do so, in order to provide you with our Service.</p>
                <p>To find out more about the purposes of processing, please refer to the relevant section of this
                  document.</p> <h4>Sale of your personal information</h4>
                <p>For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating,
                  making available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic means,
                  a consumer's personal information by the business to <strong>another business or a third party, for
                    monetary or other valuable consideration</strong>”.</p>
                <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes
                  statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network
                  plugins and the like.</p> <h4>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</h4>
                <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. This means that whenever you
                  request us to stop selling your data, we will abide by your request.<br/>Such requests can be made
                  freely, at any time, without submitting any verifiable request, simply by following the instructions
                  below.</p> <h4>Instructions to opt out of the sale of personal information</h4>
                <p>If you’d like to know more, or exercise your right to opt out in regard to all the sales carried out
                  by this Application, both online and offline, you can contact us for further information using the
                  contact details provided in this document.</p> <h4>What are the purposes for which we use your
                  personal information?</h4>
                <p>We may use your personal information to allow the operational functioning of this Application and
                  features thereof (“business purposes”). In such cases, your personal information will be processed in
                  a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business purpose for which it was collected, and strictly
                  within the limits of compatible operational purposes.</p>
                <p>We may also use your personal information for other reasons such as for commercial purposes (as
                  indicated within the section “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this
                  document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent
                  authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.</p>
                <p>We will not use your personal information for different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without
                  notifying you.</p>
                <h3>Your California privacy rights and how to exercise them</h3> <h4>The right to know and to
                  portability</h4>
                <p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for
                    which we use your information and with whom such information is shared;
                  </li>
                  <li> in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists
                    where we disclose:
                    <ul>
                      <li>for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient; and
                      </li>
                      <li>for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each
                        category of recipient.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the
                  past 12 months.</p>
                <p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e.
                  delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity
                  without hindrance – provided that this is technically feasible.</p> <h4>The right to request the
                  deletion of your personal information</h4>
                <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions
                  set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify
                  and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or
                  illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>
                <p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal
                  information and direct any of our service providers to do so.</p> <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
                <p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by
                  contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>
                <p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only
                  exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
                    we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
                  </li>
                  <li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                    respond to it.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the
                  personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
                <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the
                  California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
                <p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental
                  authority.</p>
                <p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p> <h4>How and when we are
                  expected to handle your request</h4>
                <p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how
                  we will process your request.</p>
                <p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will
                  explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we
                  may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
                <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>
                <p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is
                  manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on
                  the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
